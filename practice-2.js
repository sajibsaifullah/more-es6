                    -------------------------
                    practice problem reduce()
                    -------------------------

1. You have an array [1,9,17,22]. add the all element of this array and give output. Do this using for loop & array.reduce() method.

[**Challenging**]
2. const people = [
        {name: 'Meena', age: 20},
        {name: 'Rina', age: 15},
        {name: 'Sucorita', age: 22}
];
    Follow above array of objects. So, you have 3 objects as array element. Can you find out the total sum from here?
                20 + 15 + 22 = 57. The output will be 57.
    What are you thinking? Yeah! Do it with for loop. I know you can do it.

    But! Wait !! Wait !!! Do the same task using array.reduce() method.
